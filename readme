This is my first guided project
The Maze
Next ideas for the project

IDEAS FOR EXTENDING THE PROJECT
Add other solving algorithms, like breadth first search or A*
Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
Make much larger mazes to solve
Make it a game where there use chooses directions
If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
Make it 3 dimensional
Time the various algorithms, see which ones are fastest
